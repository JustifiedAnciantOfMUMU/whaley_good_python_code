Their performance is dependent of the signal-to-noise ratio
Artificial neural network  have become machine-learning approach for completing a wide range of tasks.
often outperforming other computational methods
current reaserch into DNN's includes training on smaller dataset

DNN's have been previously been applied to several bio-acoustic applications including some previous work with the detection of north atlantic right whale calls but also classification of different whale calls.

in all cases convelutional neural network have been leveraged to analyse information encoded in spectogram.
