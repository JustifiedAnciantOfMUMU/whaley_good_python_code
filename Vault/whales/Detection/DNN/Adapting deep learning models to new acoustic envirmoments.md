passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used for studying marine mammals

deployment f automomous recording units than can cover large remote areas and are capable of continuous data collection over long time scales 

imporovments in acoustic data collection methods have progressed faster than our ability to create effective tools to analyse recordings for the presence of marine mammal vocalizations

appealing feature of DL models is that they can be improved and tuned to new applications by simply feeding them new data

Highly adaptable to different classification tasks

DL-based detectors and classifiers still employ some sort of pre-processing step such as the computation of spectrogram

necessary annotation for the signals of interest is a costly and time consuming endevour


CNN's employ layers of convelutional filters that transform the input data in our case a spectrogram into useful features that are then used for classification
